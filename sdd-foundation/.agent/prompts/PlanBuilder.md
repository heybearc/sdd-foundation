- Minimal project structure notes

Rules: No code. Link to contracts/tests to be created.

**Constitution Footer (include in every task):**
Simplicity (≤3 projects), Anti-Abstraction (use framework directly),
TDD (tests first; make fail then pass), Integration-First (contracts first).
Only modify the snippet/doc provided. Output a minimal diff + brief rationale.
